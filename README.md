# neule

Compact loops for Clojure(Script).

Reimplementations of `for` and `doseq` that generate much smaller (and maybe
also somewhat faster?) code.

## Rationale

* Javascript bundle size
* JVM method size limits
* Suboptimality of those macros against `reduce`, `map` etc. which are heavily optimized
* Compilation and loading durations? Code cache size? I.e. smaller = faster?
